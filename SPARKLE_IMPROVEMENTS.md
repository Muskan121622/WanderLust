# Sparkle Effect Improvements

This update addresses missing CSS animations and enhances the interactive sparkle effect with better performance and accessibility.

## Changes Made

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Added missing CSS animations**: The JavaScript code referenced `fadeOut` and `flicker` animations that were not defined in the CSS
- **Fixed potential memory leaks**: Added proper cleanup for sparkle elements

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements  
- **Throttled sparkle creation**: Limited to ~60fps (16ms intervals) for smoother performance
- **Limited concurrent sparkles**: Maximum of 15 sparkles at once to prevent DOM bloat
- **Better cleanup tracking**: Prevents orphaned elements and reduces sparkle count properly

### ‚ôø Accessibility Enhancements
- **Respects user preferences**: Disables effects for users who prefer reduced motion
- **Screen reader friendly**: Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative elements
- **Better contrast**: Enhanced color palette for visual effects

### üé® Visual Improvements
- **Expanded color palette**: Added more vibrant neon colors (8 total)
- **Better animation timing**: Used proper easing functions for smoother effects
- **Improved gradient transparency**: Enhanced visual appearance with 70% transparency

## Technical Details

### CSS Animations Added
```css
@keyframes fadeOut { /* Smooth fade out with scale effect */ }
@keyframes flicker { /* Brightness flickering for neon effect */ }
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Throttling**: 16ms between sparkle creations (60fps)
- **Memory management**: Automatic cleanup after 800ms
- **Concurrent limit**: Max 15 sparkles for optimal performance

### Accessibility Features
- Automatically detects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- Gracefully disables effects for users with motion sensitivity
- Maintains full functionality without visual effects

## Testing

The improvements maintain backward compatibility while fixing the missing animations that could cause console errors. Users with motion preferences disabled will see no performance impact, while other users will experience smoother, more visually appealing effects.
