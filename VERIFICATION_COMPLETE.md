# ✅ BLANK PAGE ISSUE - COMPLETELY FIXED!

## 🎉 What Was Wrong

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. **Restored boilerplate.ejs** ✅
- Complete HTML structure with DOCTYPE, head, body
- Proper EJS syntax for conditional title: `<% if (typeof title !== 'undefined') { %>`
- All CSS and JS files with cache-busting timestamps
- Includes: navbar, flash messages, footer, chatbot

### 2. **Fixed Emergency Cache Clear** ✅
- Added `sessionStorage` flag to run only ONCE
- Conditional reload only if caches exist
- No more infinite reload loops

### 3. **Simplified Service Worker Management** ✅
- Removed conflicting registrations
- Self-destructing sw.js
- Clean session-based cleanup
