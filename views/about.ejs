  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">💡 Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Born from the idea that travel should be more personal and less transactional, 
    Wanderlust was created by a small group of developers and explorers who wanted 
    to reimagine how people travel. Inspired by platforms like Airbnb, we designed 
    Wanderlust with simplicity, trust, and community at its core.
